We entered the bus using the front door. The bus was empty, there was only a driver and maybe one or two persons.

- |Dzień dobry|[Good morning] – said Damba to the driver. The driver was busy looking at his phone, probably texting his wife or playing Candy Crush Saga.

- We don’t greet drivers in public transport. We do in intercity buses, but in city transport we don’t – I explained.

- What? Are these drivers worse than the others?

- No, it’s just culture. We’re used to do it this way.

- In my culture we always greet drivers. Basically, if one doesn’t do it, we might think they’re not a {dobry} person. And I think drivers in the city are as {dobry} as those in intercity buses – Damba seemed quite confident that his beliefs were correct, even though here it was different. In the meantime, more and more people entered the bus.

- In Poland someone might say {dzień dobry} to a driver if they see them every |dzień|[day]. But generally we don’t do it.

- Well, I don’t care.

I didn’t know if he felt angry or not, I didn’t know him well at that time. Did he mean that he was going to change the world or what? I don’t know.

- {Przepraszam}, is this ticket |dobry|[good]? – some girl asked me, showing me her ticket. A normal ticket from here.

- Yes, it’s {dobry} – answered a young bloke, apparently he was living in Wrocław too. He probably wanted to make a good impression on her. Well, who wouldn’t?
